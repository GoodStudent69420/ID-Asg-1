# ID-Asg-1
This is my ID assignment 1 repo

--- Overview ---
The main purpose that I wanted my website to be able to fulfil is to be a platform where products can be sold. The product category that I chose was shoes. The name of the website is Sprint. The website will be easy to use and also have easy to read cues, so as to not let the user be confused as to where they need to click next.

--- Design process ---
The first things that I focused on for the website when designing it in the wireframe was the simplicity of it. I had decided early on that I did not want it to look cramped and chock full of information. I also decided that the color scheme of the website must be soothing to the eyes. This website can be useful for anyone who wants a place where they can sell their products. Because of the simplicity of the website both on how it looks and also the code, anyone can easily modify the contents of it without much trouble. 

I have used different websites for my referece. The main ones that I have used were the Nike and Adidas websites. I used them as when I was clicking around on the websites, I liked how there are no roundabout ways in the website, meaning that the user could checkout and buy the product within 4 or 5 clicks when they first go into the website. I have also used W3S for reference for the slideshow.

--- Features ---
On the meain page, there are 3 main sections. The first one will be a slideshow where users can see what the website is about and some of the products that it has to offer. The second portion will be the trending boxes where users will be can see what products are currently be bought the most. The last part is the Featured portion. This is where users can see the products that are recommended to them. If they are not already on it, users just need to click on the logo at the top left corner to get to the main page.

Next is the product page. Users can get to this page by clicking on "Products" on the navigation bar. The product page will be where all the products are being shown in the format of many boxes. There, the user willbe able to scroll through the page to find a product.

The last page is the about page. It can be accessed by clicking on "About" on the navigation bar. On this page, the user can find the company's motto and also a little something about the founder.

Lastly there is the navigation bar itself, the secondary navigation portion and also the footer. The secondary navigation is on every page except the about page. On the navigation bar, as mentioned earlier, there is the logo to go to the main page, products button to go to the products page, the about button to go to the about page and also a contact button, although it does not work. In addition to those however, there is also the login and cart button. For now, only the login button works. The login button is the one with the person inside a circle. Clicking on it will display a pop-up display for login. On the login display, there is also a prompt for sign-up at the bottom if the user does not have an account. Clicking on the signup will simply close the login window and pop-up the sign up window. To close both the login and sign up window, simply click on the "x" at the top right of the display. The pop-ups work on all pages.

On the secondary nav bar, there is the product, support and comapany header. Sadly, only the "shoes" text under the product header and the "about" text under the company header work

The footer is at the bottom of every page. It includes the social media icons, however they are not linked to anywhere as there is no existing social media for the website. The other buttons are simply for display if the user wants to link them to somwhere. Only the sign up text links to the sign up display. 

--- Technologies Used ---
HTML,
CSS, 
Javascript

--- Testing ---
For the responsive part, in the index page, I also tried to make it work on an iphone X. The trending section will flex into a column and most of the text in the page will shrink. This is mostly the same for the product page, with the exception that the product boxes will either have 1, 2 or 3 colums depending on screen size. For the about page, most things will also flex into column to accomodate for a smaller screen. For a better idea of what I imagined the pages to look like in responsive design, I have inclued them in the Xd file.
